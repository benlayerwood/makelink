* Introduction
The makelink-tool duplicates a file-structure with hard links for all files. This saves a lot of space, because the files only use one inode in the file system.
It traverses the directory structure and duplicates the directories (because one can't hard link directories).

* Build
#+begin_src shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
#+end_src

* Execute
#+begin_src shell
./makelink [<src directory>] [<dest directory>]
#+end_src
